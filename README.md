# Creating the Sidekiq Worker `gem 'sidekiq-cron'`

In Sidekiq, background jobs are executed by workers. We’ll create a worker called PostFetcherWorker to fetch posts from an external API and update the local database with the retrieved data.

# Configuring Sidekiq Scheduler

We need to configure Sidekiq to schedule the PostFetcherWorker to run at regular intervals.

# Adding Sidekiq Routes

To monitor and manage Sidekiq jobs, we need to add the Sidekiq web interface to our application’s routes. With this configuration, the Sidekiq web interface will be accessible at http://localhost:3000/sidekiq. Additionally, we have defined a route for the posts#index action, which you can customize based on your application's requirements.

# Running Sidekiq

`bundle exec sidekiq`
